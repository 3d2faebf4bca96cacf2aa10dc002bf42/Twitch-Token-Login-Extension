# Chrome Extension specific (if any build output or temporary files were generated)
# For this simple extension, there aren't typical build outputs,
# but if you were to add a build step, you'd add its output directory here.
# For example:
# dist/
# build/

# Environment variables (if you were to use a .env file, which is not typical for extensions)
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local

# Logs
*.log
